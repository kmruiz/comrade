# Project glossary

Project keywords and their meaning, with references to the code or documentation where they appear. One `## term` section per keyword, sorted alphabetically. Look terms up with read_glossary, search with find_glossary, add or update with remember_glossary.

## approval ([[delegates]])
> Per-[[delegates]] config key (crates/comrade-core/src/config.rs DelegateCfg.approval) controlling whether delegate/ask_advise may run that model without asking: "auto" (default) runs directly, "ask" pauses via ToolContext::confirm (skipped when the context is auto-approved), "deny" refuses to run that model through delegate/ask_advise at all. Enforced by delegate::enforce_approval inside DelegateTool::invoke and AskAdviseTool::invoke before a run starts (and before a delegated plan step is marked working).

**References:**
- `crates/comrade-core/src/config.rs`
- `crates/comrade-core/src/delegate.rs (enforce_approval, cfg_line)`
- `crates/comrade-core/src/advise.rs`
- `.comrade/memory/0003-per-delegate-approval-policy-for-delegateask-advise.md`

**Notes:**
Reuses the Autonomy enum (ask/auto/deny). Delegates with ask/deny are annotated in listings via delegate::cfg_line.

## ask_advise
> Consultations normally need no approval, but the chosen delegate's `approval` policy applies (see "approval ([[delegates]])"): `ask` pauses for human approval before the advice runs, `deny` refuses outright.

**References:**
- `crates/comrade-core/src/advise.rs`
- `.comrade/memory/0003-per-delegate-approval-policy-for-delegateask-advise.md`

**Notes:**
Replaces the former unconditional "no approval" wording.
